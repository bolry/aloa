1. Eclipse CDT users (tested with Galileo 3.5)

    Simply choose 'Import | General | Existing Projects into Workspace' from
    the Eclipse Project Explorer and point to your ALOA root directory.

2. Make users

    Simply change to 'make' directory and type 'make'. 
    By default, make performs a debug build; in order to make a release build,
    do this:
     
        'make TARGET=RELEASE'
