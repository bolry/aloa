This is a VERY simple test but better than nothing!

lint.output.xml 
    Some sample Lint output (from the Bash source code) in XML format
    understood by ALOA.

aloa.output
    Reference output generated by ALOA if you feed lint.output.xml to it.

Run YOUR version of ALOA and feed it lint.output.xml -- see if the output still
matches!
