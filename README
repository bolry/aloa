4.1.0  2010-12-26   NEW   XML output, major refactoring, Doxygen documentation,
                          make test, make todo, make doxy.
4.1.1  2011-01-16   FIX   Lint issues with numbers >= 1000 didn't work.
4.2.0  2011-01-28   NEW   PC-Lint support ('make lint' etc.)
                    NEW   Cleanup of lint issues
                    FIX   Minor bugfixes (exit code was not 0 if no lint issues
                          were found, handling of malformed lint output files.)
                    NEW   'make deploy'
4.2.1  2011-10-09   NEW   Support for release builds via 'make TARGET=RELEASE'.
                    NEW   tools/gcclint: support for Cygwin.
                    NEW   Minor Lint policy improvements.
4.2.2  2013-08-08   FIX   Updated version info
4.3.0  2013-11-25   NEW   Support for multiple lint output files (-f may appear
                          more than once).
4.4.0  2013-12-17   CNG   Correction to 4.3.0: -f may not appear more than once
                          anymore. Any additional lint output files must come
                          directly after first lint output file.
                    NEW   Support for fine-grained reports of MISRA issues (-m)
                          through so-called "virtual issues".
4.5.0  2013-12-30   NEW   Merged gcclint and g++lint. Now there is only gcclint
                          and it supports both, C and C++.

Usage:

- Do a PC-Lint run and use Gimpel's env-xml.lnt file to produce XML-formatted
  output.
- Redirect standard output to a file, e. g. output.xml.
- Run ALOA and provide the output file as an argument, e. g.:
    aloa -f output.xml

For further information consult the ALOA help, e. g.:
    aloa --help
