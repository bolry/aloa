                         ALOA -- A Lint Output Analyzer.

When this is ready, it will be the GCC/G++ version of the original ALOA tool
(http://www.approxion.com/?page_id=26). Maybe it will be even more. Who knows?

Usage:

- Do a PC-Lint run and use Gimpel's env-xml.lnt file to produce XML-formatted
  output.
- Redirect standard output to a file, e. g. output.xml.
- Run ALOA and provide the output file as an argument, e. g.:
    aloa -f output.xml

For further information consult the ALOA help, e. g.:
    aloa --help
